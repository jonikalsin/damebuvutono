He was born in Atlanta and is reportedly a former athlete who played for the Troy State Trojans while attending Troy University in Alabama. During his time, he played point guard and played it well.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>HIS CAREER</strong></p><p class=Fg>His love for the sport may be what <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.distractify.com/p/toya-wright-boyfriend-robert-rushing>inspired him</a> to become a sports manager for athletes.

She <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://heavy.com/entertainment/2018/09/lil-wayne-ex-wife-toya-wright/>shares her</a> with her former husband, Lil Wayne.</p><p class=Fg>Aside from him, she has been romantically linked to producer Memphitz.
