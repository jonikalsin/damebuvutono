She doesn't want to talk or deal with her problems, instead, she just wants to watch TV to distract herself. The drowning metaphor suggests a desire to lose herself in the comfort of the familiar sound and sight of the TV. Billie also highlights the betrayal portrayed on Survivor, seeming to claim that everyone is out for themselves and only wants to win, making the emotional stakes of real-life relationships all the more potent. She then muses on the loss of friendship due to love and how it was only fine because one is in love. The chorus seems to paint the picture of someone consumed by their own love, unable to see that they are neglecting other important things in their life, such as their friendships. But then in the last verse, Billie confronts the possibility that she is the one causing the distance from her friends, suggesting a deeper introspective turn in the song.</p><br><p>Interestingly, the song finishes the verse talking about movie stars on trial as they overturn Roe v. Wade, this could either be a comment on the current political situation or just more emphasis on the role of the TV as a distractor of real life issues. The song's message seems to be about the cost of escapism, the dangers of disregarding those closest to us and facing the consequences of not dealing with problems head-on.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>I don't wanna talk right now</u><br>I don't feel like communicating with anyone at the moment.</p><br><p><u>I just wanna watch TV</u><br>I want to distract myself by watching television.</p><br><p><u>I'll stay in the pool and drown</u><br>I would rather escape my problems by drowning myself in my thoughts.</p><br><p><u>So I don't have to watch you leave</u><br>I am trying to avoid getting hurt by avoiding the person who is leaving.</p><br><p><u>I put on Survivor just to watch somebody suffer</u><br>I'm intentionally watching something that displays other people struggling, just to distract myself from my own issues.</p><br><p><u>Maybe I should get some sleep</u><br>Perhaps it's better for me to rest and reset my mind.</p><br><p><u>Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other</u><br>I am allowing myself to get lost in the drama of TV characters instead of facing my own issues with people who have betrayed me.</p><br><p><u>What's the point of anything?</u><br>I am feeling hopeless and questioning the purpose of everything.</p><br><p><u>All of my friends are missing again</u><br>I am feeling isolated and alone.</p><br><p><u>That's what happens when you fall in love</u><br>Being in a relationship often makes you lose touch with friends and other relationships.</p><br><p><u>You don't have the time, you leave them all behind</u><br>When you're in love, it's easy to get lost in the relationship and forget about other important people in your life.</p><br><p><u>You tell yourself it's fine, you're just in love</u><br>You justify your actions with the idea that your focus on your relationship is out of love.</p><br><p><u>Don't know where you are right now</u><br>I am unsure of where the person who left me is, and I'm still struggling to come to terms with it.</p><br><p><u>Did you see me on TV?</u><br>I am seeking attention and validation from the one who left me.</p><br><p><u>I'll try not to starve myself</u><br>I'm determined not to let my emotions impact my physical well-being.</p><br><p><u>Just because you're mad at me</u><br>I don't want to punish myself with things like starvation just because the person who left me is angry with me.</p><br><p><u>And I'll be in denial for at least a little while</u><br>I am trying not to face the reality of the situation because it's too much for me to handle right now.</p><br><p><u>What about the plans we made?</u><br>I am questioning what will happen to the plans that we had made together now that the person has left.</p><br><p><u>The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial</u><br>I am observing and criticizing society's tendency to pay attention to irrelevant things over important events and news.</p><br><p><u>While they're overturning Roe v.
