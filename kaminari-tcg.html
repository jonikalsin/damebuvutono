The deck is classified as one of the tournament winning decks, containing more rare cards and strategy than other easy-to-build decks.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Description>Description</span></h2><p><b>CONCEPTS:</b> <i>"Kaminari" is the Romaji word for the "Lightning" class of Pokémon Types. This "Kaminari" deck is dedicated to all the themes that make Lightning such a destructive force: Defender destruction, bench destruction, and plenty of self destruction. This can barely be classified an "Evolution" deck when both evolutions are only Stage 1. And the Electrodes are only really included for their Buzzap Pokémon Power and getting some Fossil Zapdos powered up for attacking.</i></p><p><b>TIPS FOR PLAYING:</b> <i>Your entire focus when playing Kaminari is to beat away at your opponent's bench while trying to keep your own bench safe from self inflicted damage. Bench Destruction has been a theme in existence since the original Base set of Pokémon TCG cards were released, but only now after the Fossil expansion came out do we have a truly viable tournament ready Bench Destruction deck.</i></p><p>Jungle Pikachu, Fossil Raichu, and Fossil Zapdos are the Pokémon best fitting the theme of Kaminari. Pikachu and Raichu are the most selective of these Pokémon, allowing you to choose the benched monsters that you attack. Always choose the Pokémon that your opponent is developing for future rounds of attack. Typically this will be the Pokémon with an evolution or two in place and lots of energy cards. Zapdos absolutely loves a full bench to Thunderstorm! There is plenty of coin flipping fun to be had here.</p><p>Use Electabuzz early in the game when energy is at a minimum and you want to apply the most pressure possible. Don't be afraid to Switch him or even Scoop him up when his time has come. That's what these trainer cards are included for.</p><p><b>PITFALLS:</b> <i>This deck is very weak to Fighting type opponents. Fortunately Zapdos' resistance will come in handy during these match-ups. Be certain that every Pokémon on your bench is ready to attack, so an untimely Gust of Wind or Energy Removal by the opposing player doesn't put you into a bad situation. Always be prepared for these kind of disruptive trainers by keeping only powered up Pokémon on your bench, preferably with multiple options to choose from.</i></p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Deck_list>Deck list</span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorzEnaCaZpKquaOtxpqpnZ2eY7umwI6woKShX4CurrXNmqmil1iJkIh1</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
