After the tour, Amil appeared on songs with:</p><ul><li>Funkmaster Flex, an American record producer, actor, disc jockey, rapper, and host on New York City’s Hot 97 radio station;</li><li>LL Cool J;</li><li>DJ Kay Slay;</li><li>AZ;</li><li>Jermaine Dupri;</li><li>Beyoncé;</li><li>Mariah Carey.</li></ul><p>On September 19, 2000, she released her debut solo album, A.M.I.L – All Money Is Legal. Her 2000 solo debut featured the single “I Got That” featuring Beyonce.</p><p>During an interview, Whitehead said:</p><p><strong>“For a female in this game to write her own stuff is a big statement. I hope that with All Money Is Legal, people will get the chance to hear what I have to say and the life that I’ve lived.”</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, the sales of the ”All Money Is Legal” album were disappointing, and the singles did not sell well either.</p><p>Also, she is a practicing Black Hebrew Israelite (a group of Black Americans who believe that they are descendants of the ancient Israelites), and her affiliation is evident in songs such as “Quarrels.”</p><p>Moreover, the album features:</p><ul><li>Beanie Sigel;</li><li>Eve;</li><li>Carl Thomas;</li><li>Jay-Z;</li><li>Memphis Bleek.</li></ul><p>After ”All Money Is Legal,” her last Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam single was released: “Hey Papi” – a song from the soundtrack to the feature film ”The Nutty Professor II.”</p><p>In 2005, she temporarily re-formed “Major Coinz” and released songs on the mixtape circuit, including the single “Glamorous Life” that was featured on MTV Mixtape Monday.</p><p>In a 2006 interview, when asked whether female MCs are forced to meet standards that male MCs are not, Kahala said:</p><p><strong>“Oh, yeah. Definitely. You have to be picture-perfect and you have to meet the standards of the perfect woman. That’s unreal to me.”</strong></p><p>She later added:</p><p><strong>”Real women do not have plastic-looking bodies. The average woman is not a size 0. You can do what you have to do to keep yourself looking like that or you could just be you. Me, I choose to just be me.”</strong></p><p>In 2008, Whitehead released mixtapes entitled ”Az Iz and Amil Returns The Lost Classics Edition,” with songs like the Caribbean vibed “Don’t Worry” and the emotional “Tears of a Teenage Mother.”</p><p>In July 2012, off of her forthcoming mixtape A time to kill, Kahala released the new music “Stop.”</p><p>In 2014, she released “Remember” off of her forthcoming mixtape ”Another Moment in Life.”</p><h2><strong>Children</strong></h2><p>She has four children.</p><h2><strong>Trivia</strong></h2><p>In August 2011, Kahala spoke out through Vibe Magazine and gave the following statement about Jay-Z:</p><p><strong>“I haven’t spoken to Jay in years but I really wish I could talk to him because that would just really bring closure to me. But he knows I love him.”</strong></p><p>Kahala continued:</p><p><strong>“People think there was bad blood between us, but there never was any bad blood. Things happen and I wasn’t ready for where my career was going at that time. It was really overwhelming.”</strong></p><p>Her earliest influences were classic rap groups, like – Run-D.M.C., who she would practice and mimic rapping over when she was young.</p><p>In 2002, she had a small role in State Property along with other Roc-a-Fella members, like – Jay-Z and Dame Dash (an American entrepreneur, film producer, director, record executive, and actor).</p><p>Throughout her career, Kahala has appeared on many songs with:</p><ul><li>Memphis Bleek and Beanie Siegel on “For My Thugs”;</li><li>Ja Rule on “Can I Get A…”;</li><li>Jay-Z on “Nigga What, Nigga Who”.</li></ul><p>Other famous musicians are <a href=#>Mindless Behavior</a>, <a href=#>rapper TM88</a>, <a href=#>country music singer Mark Chesnutt</a>.</p><p><strong>READ MORE: </strong><a href=#>Nick Miller Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Amil – Net Worth</strong></h2><p>So, how much is Amil Kahala Whitehead worth?&nbsp;Whitehead earned most of her wealth by selling tickets to her concerts, sponsors, selling copies of her albums (Amil Az Iz and All Money Is Legal), collaborating with different artists, or even just collecting her royalties the right way.
