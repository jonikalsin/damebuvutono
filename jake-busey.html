His only previous experience in the field was a part in “Straight Time” with his father, actor Gary Busey, when he was 5.</p><p>But just because he was the son of a well-known Hollywood star didn’t mean that young Busey didn’t have his work cut out for him. For three years, the 6-foot-3 thespian struggled, going to auditions and not getting hired.</p><p>Just when he was considering giving it all up to join the National Guard as a helicopter pilot, Busey started to land small roles in movies such as “Contact,” “Starship Troopers,” “Home Fries” and “Enemy of the State.” He also starred in the TV series “Shasta McNasty.”</p><p>In addition to “Tomcats,” Busey recently shot an independent film, “Fast Sofa,” opposite Natasha Lyonne and Jennifer Tilly. He’s currently shooting “The First $20 Million Is Always the Hardest,” based on the novel by Po Bronson.</p><p>The 29-year- old charmer lives in Santa Monica and spends his free time playing bass guitar in a band and flying his propeller plane, a Piper Saratoga.</p><p><strong>Q: Did you learn anything while filming the movie “Tomcats”?</strong></p><p>A: A thong is not all that comfortable and not my favorite piece of clothing.</p><p><strong>Q: What do you lounge around the house in?</strong></p><p>A: I think a pink sequined robe is my favorite.</p><p><strong>Q: What is your personal style?</strong></p><p>A: 1960s ultra lounge, hillbilly punk rock.</p><p><strong>Q: What is the wackiest thing you ever wore?</strong></p><p>A: These giant, pink old-lady glasses with a leopard-print shirt and red Dickies pants.</p><p><strong>Q: Is there an item of clothing you can’t live without?</strong></p><p>A: I have a 1950s burgundy blazer sport coat that I’ve been accused of wearing far too much. And I’ve had too mellow out on that.</p><p><strong>Q: What do you wear for a big night out?</strong></p><p>A: I’ll wear slacks. I’ll throw on a nice shirt. Maybe depending on the season, I’ll hit a little dinner coat, something that fits my taste. I also have a nice brown 1946 sharkskin suit that’s one of my favorites.</p><p><strong>Q: Favorite designers?</strong></p><p>A: BC [British Columbia] Ethic. And I’m a fan of the Hugo Boss and the Armani suits. In fact, I wore a nice Tommy Hilfiger that wasn’t too bad.</p><p><strong>Q: How do you get your hair to stick up so straight, yet remain so chic?</strong></p><p>A: I use a very secret ancient Chinese recipe – motor oil. I get a little bit of a gas-station smell going but, hey, it works.</p><p><strong>Q: What would you NEVER wear?</strong></p><p>A: Dockers, a leopard-skin thong, a tie or stiletto heels.</p><p><strong>Q: What do you do to relax?</strong></p><p>A: Jacuzzis and red wine.</p><p><strong>Q: How do you stay in shape?</strong></p><p>A: An occasional jog. And I’m a big fan of skateboarding and rollerblading. And swimming is a big one on my list.</p><p><strong>Q: Do you follow a special diet?</strong></p><p>A: I’ve been doing the Atkins regimen for eight years.</p><p><strong>Q: Favorite restaurants/nightspots?</strong></p><p>A: Yoshinoya is pretty cool. It’s a Japanese restaurant on the top of a mountain in Hollywood. I also like dive bars with a pool table and a juke box. I don’t go for the real chi-chi, trendy clubs.</p><p><strong>Q: Whose style do you most admire?</strong></p><p>A: Elvis in the early days had a great style. I liked his suits. I like Johnny Cash too, wearing all black. He’s kind of a badass country guy.</p><p><strong>Q: What don’t you ever leave home without or always carry?</strong></p><p>A: My wallet with all of my identification in case I’m abducted and I need to prove my identity to re-enter the country.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfXJ7j21mam1fn66ssYybrKydqWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
