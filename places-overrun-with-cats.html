As of 2019, there were an estimated 286 cats living in the village of Houtong.</p><p>In the 1920s, Houtong was a thriving coal-mining town, which was then under Japanese colonial rule. It was home to 6,000 residents and workers. But the community began to shrink after the mine was shut down in 1990.</p><p>As residents began to move away in search of better jobs, Houtong's human population shrank to about 100 residents. The number of stray cats that inhabited the town, meanwhile, grew until it was overrun.</p><p>In 2008, a local blogger and cat person named Jian Peiling began <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">snapping</a> photographs of the village's growing feline population. She also coordinated with volunteers to help care for the cats and make sure that they were properly vaccinated.</p><p>News of the curious cat village spread online and it became a tourist attraction now known as Houtong Cat Village.</p>The cats of Houtong are cared for by villagers with help from donations and volunteers.<p>The Taiwanese government rebranded the town as a cat lover's paradise and retrofitted many of the city's services. They built an award-winning pedestrian "cat bridge" as well as an educational center that features elevated cat walkways.</p><p>Houtong, which is only a 40-minute train ride away from the country's capital Taipei, is now full of cat-themed shops and restaurants. In 2010, the village attracted about 500 annual visitors. That number rose to nearly one million annual visitors in just six years.</p><p>While the Houtong Cat Village has become a wonderful home for cats, reports suggest that the town has inadvertently become a dumping ground for pet owners, too. Zhan Biyun, a 65-year-old resident who has been caring for the town's cats over the years, adopted two cats of her own. She found them as kittens abandoned by a cliff near her house.</p><p>"There are people who adopt cats without thinking seriously about it, and abandon them as soon as they don't want them anymore," Zhan said. Volunteers said that the majority of original cat occupants had been neutered, so any kittens likely came from outside the village.</p><p>The local government has enacted a fine of $5,119 for anyone who abandons their cat inside the town. Hopefully, such policies combined with increased educational efforts will prevent people from acting irresponsibly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyxuMCcnKxln6uys77Up2SwoaSdeqSt06xmbg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
