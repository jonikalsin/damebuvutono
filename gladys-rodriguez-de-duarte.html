To make matters even stranger, the funeral home she was taken to was oddly named Duarte e Hijos — or Duarte and Sons.</p><p>It was here that staffers finally realized the supposed cadaver was actually a living, breathing woman — as the body bag began to move.</p><p>“We trusted him, that’s why we went there,” said Duarte Ferreira of Dr. Vera. “But they disconnected her and passed her off to the funeral home.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-276146 alt="Standard Death Certificate Up Close" width=900 height=480 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/standard-death-certificate-up-close.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-276146 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Twitter</span><span class=caption-body>Husband Maximino Duarte Ferreira said he was simply handed his wife’s naked body and a death certificate.</span></p><p>De Duarte has since been taken to a medical facility of Paraguay’s Social Welfare Institute. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to ABC Color</a>, the “resurrected” patient is currently under observation and in “delicate but stable” condition. As for the enraged husband’s complaint, Dr. Vera’s colleagues claimed it was unfounded.</p><p>“He tried to revive her, but it was unsuccessful,” said fellow physician Dr. Catalino Fabio, adding that Dr. Vera had been unable to locate the patient’s pulse.</p><p>While admitting that an accredited physician had trouble finding a patient’s pulse is a rather odd excuse, Dr. Fabio explained that more nuanced issues may have played a part. Even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexander the Great might have been buried alive</a>, after all.</p><p>She speculated that catalepsy, a condition in which muscles become rigid and a lack of response to outside stimuli takes hold, was the true culprit in this affair. Ultimately, her distraught husband has forged ahead and filed an official complaint against Dr. Vera.</p><p>While his claim that the medics intentionally pronounced his wife dead because they no longer wanted to treat her has yet to be proven, it’s certainly a natural, emotional response to such a traumatizing event.</p><p>After learning about the woman who woke up in a body bag after being mistakenly pronounced dead, read about <a href=#>five terrifying true stories of people being buried alive</a>.
