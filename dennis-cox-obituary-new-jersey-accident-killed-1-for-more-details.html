The passage of time brought both moments of joy and sorrow, and Dennis navigated these ebbs and flows with grace and resilience. Dennis’s professional journey led him to a 31-year career at McGill in Valparaiso, Indiana, where he dedicated his efforts to his work. A diligent and hardworking individual, Dennis found fulfillment in his role and took pride in his contributions.</p><p>Retirement brought new chapters to Dennis’s life, allowing him to immerse himself in the activities he loved. A passionate gardener, he cultivated beauty in his surroundings, tending to a pristine lawn and nurturing a koi fish pond that became a point of pride. His green thumb mirrored the care and attention he bestowed upon those around him, symbolizing a life devoted to growth and flourishing.&nbsp;Dennis’s love for the outdoors extended to his lifelong passion as a Cubs fan. Through victories and defeats, he remained steadfast in his support for the team, a testament to his loyalty and enduring spirit.</p><p>As the final inning of Dennis’s life unfolded, his absence left a void that can only be filled with the memories of a loving protector and provider. The community mourns the loss of a man who touched lives with his kindness, dedication, and unwavering love. Dennis D. Cox will be dearly missed, but his legacy lives on in the hearts of those blessed enough to have known him.&nbsp;In remembrance of Dennis, a service to honor his memory is an opportunity for family and friends to gather, share stories, and find solace in each other’s company.</p><p>The service will take place at the Jim W. Henderson Administration and Welcome Center, Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, on November 12, at 2:00 p.m. In lieu of flowers, the family kindly requests donations to a Go Fund Me fundraiser, contributing directly to the Morrison Family to ease the financial burdens during this difficult time. As the community joins together to celebrate Dennis’s life, they find comfort in the legacy of a man whose impact will resonate for generations to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaJyVo7uqv4ycprFln5e2tcHAq7BmppWsequx0aycsmWRmLCqsMSnq2ajmaG5prCMamSfp6JiurC%2BxGabnqyRnrm0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
