People had started to die, and the town’s 1,400 residents desperately needed a serum to stave off a catastrophe. But with the ports blocked by ice and planes grounded by winter weather, there was only one way the serum could get there: by sled. Before long, one intrepid dog named <a href=# rel=noopener>Balto</a> became a national hero.</p><p>Born around 1919 in Nome, Alaska, Balto was a black Siberian husky with a distinctive white leg. During the 1925 Serum Run, Balto was tasked with leading the final 54-mile leg of the 674-mile route alongside his musher, Gunnar Kaasen, and another dog named Fox.</p><p>Though they were the last of the sled teams to embark on the six-day mission, Kaasen, Balto, and Fox faced extreme conditions as they carried the life-saving serum toward Nome. Temperatures plunged to -40 degrees Fahrenheit, and a harsh wind created whiteout conditions that Kaasen could hardly see through. At one point, his sled even flipped, which meant that Kaasen had to dig through the snow with his bare hands to recover the precious antitoxin package he was transporting.</p><p>On Feb. 2, 1925, Balto and his team finally arrived in Nome and delivered the serum to the town’s residents. “Damn fine dog,” Kaasen said of Balto.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-455478 alt="Gunnar Kaasen And Balto In Central Park" width=900 height=564 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gunnar-kaasen-and-balto-in-central-park.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-455478 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Bettmann/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Gunnar Kaasen, Balto, and the Balto statue in Central Park.</span></p><p>For Americans across the country who had followed the harrowing story on the radio, Balto quickly became a national hero. But not everyone saw Balto that way — including his breeder Leonhard Seppala.</p><p>Seppala had also participated in the 1925 Serum Run with another of his dogs, Togo. He thought the praise lauded on Balto was unfair because Balto had co-led the final leg with Fox and because Togo had covered more miles over rougher terrain. Togo ran 261 miles, whereas Balto ran just over 50 miles.</p><p>As such, Seppala believed that the praise for Balto was overblown, and he didn’t think that Balto deserved to have a statue erected in his honor in New York City’s Central Park. (Today, Togo also has a statue, albeit a smaller one, in the city’s Seward Park.)</p><p>“I hope I shall never be the man to take away credit from any dog or driver who participated in that run,” Seppala said in his <a href=# rel=noopener>memoir</a>. “We all did our best. But when the country was roused to enthusiasm over the Serum Drive, I resented the statue to Balto, for if any dog deserved special mention it was Togo.”</p><p>It can be agreed today, however, that Balto, Togo, Fox, and all the other dogs who participated in the 1925 Serum Run played a heroic role in delivering life-saving medicine to a desperate town.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonynrcyorKxllKS0tA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
