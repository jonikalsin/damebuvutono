He’s been denied parole <a href=#>at least 12 times</a>.</p><p>Whelan said the “official narrative” says Lennon was shot from behind, but his interviews and research with the surgeon and nurses, among others, indicated that Lennon was shot by someone in front of him.</p><p>In addition, Whelan said, it was dark that night and Chapman was reportedly about 25 feet from Lennon when he fired, a vast distance for an untrained marksman. Yet the bullets entered Lennon in a close grouping that looked professional, Whelan said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Mark David Chapman pleaded guilty to fatally shooting Lennon and is serving a 20 years-to-life sentence at an upstate prison.

No one disputes that Chapman was the gunman. He’s <a href=#>confessed repeatedly and apologized</a>.”</p><p>Whelan still can’t explain exactly what happened.</p><p>“The motive isn’t totally clear, and it doesn’t necessarily have to be a CIA/Deep State operation,” he said. “There are links between fundamentalist Christians and these hypnotist doctors and Nixon as well. Nixon and Lennon were arch enemies, and Nixon was close to [Ronald] Reagan,” who was president-elect when the former Beatle was shot.</p><p>“Lennon was just coming out of his shell and getting back to political activity and Reagan was coming into office,” Whelan observed.</p><p>Whelan alleges that key information surrounding the assassination was “hushed up” by the NYPD and the District Attorney’s office and said the autopsy report was never released by then-Medical Examiner Elliot Gross.</p><p>But Wedge said he and his co-authors saw the autopsy report during their research and didn’t find any major discrepancies.</p><p>Whelan uncovered numerous documents in the case. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Mail</a> was the first to publish Chapman’s “hit list,” courtesy of Whelan, which included newsman Walter Cronkite, late-night host Johnny Carson, actors George C.
