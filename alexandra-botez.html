While working as an engineer, her father began teaching chess to Alexandra when she was just six years old. While sharing her childhood memories, Alexandra revealed that once her father claimed that he could train Alexandra to play chess within only two weeks, after which she would be able to beat her mother. She said,</p><p>My mom only plays a little. So he made a bet that he could teach me to play and that, in only two weeks, I would be able to beat her.”</p><p>Surprisingly, Alexandra actually managed to beat her mother which made her father realize that she possessed some special skills at chess. Eventually, her father started taking Alexandra to local parks to challenge old-timers. Later, her family moved to Oregon, United States, where she did her schooling at Clackamas High School. At school, she was a member of the CHS chess team, which was named the overall first-place winner in the varsity division of the Oregon High School Chess Team Association (OSAA) championships. Thereafter, she pursued a Bachelor of Arts at Stanford University, California, where she studied international relations with a focus on China. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_1><a href=#>[1]</a></span> At Stanford, Alexandra was the first female president of the university’s chess club.
