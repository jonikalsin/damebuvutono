This certain exception had to be made….”, the 29-year-old hitmaker captioned her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TikTok video</a>. In the clip, Ariana could be seen vocalizing the track and cutting the mix together on her computer. Although neither she nor the 33-year-old singer has confirmed what song it is, many fans speculate that it is The Weeknd’s 2016 track “Die for You”, given the brief lyrics that the songstress belted out.</p><a title=@arianagrande href=# rel=nofollow>@arianagrande</a><p id=content-paragraph-3>⭐️🌙</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><a title="♬ original sound - arianagrande" href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>♬ original sound – arianagrande</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Not only did the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Grammy winner</a> give fans a preview of herself editing the song, but she could also even be heard singing some of the track’s chorus. “You know what I’m thinkin’, see it in your eyes / You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry,” she sang.
