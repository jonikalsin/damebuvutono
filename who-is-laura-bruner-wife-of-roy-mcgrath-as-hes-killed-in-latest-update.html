He was the former governor of Maryland. Over three weeks after McGrath skipped court, he was finally captured. McGrath was accused of forging official documents and was charged with federal wire fraud and theft.</span></p><p><span>On Monday, the bureau released a statement stating that the suspect, Roy McGrath, suffered an injury during the arrest and was sent to the hospital. McGrath had a gunshot wound, but the cause of death and whether it was intentional or not are still unknown.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, the FBI confirmed that they are reviewing an agent-involved shooting.</span></p><p>Advertisement</p><h2><strong>Who is Laura Bruner wife of ex-Maryland governor Roy McGrath as he’s killed in latest update</strong></h2><p><span>On Tuesday, March 14, McGrath was listed as wanted by the US Marshals Service. Laura Bruner, Roy McGrath’s wife, was reported to be cooperating with law enforcement officials as the news of the nationwide manhunt broke.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>According to Joseph Murtha, McGrath’s attorney, Laura Bruner was concerned about his well-being but unaware of his whereabouts. The 36-year-old Bruner was reportedly staying with her friends for a few weeks. Bruner and Roy had been sharing a home in Naples, Florida.</span></p><h4><b>Roy McGrath’s Death Was Confirmed By Laura Bruner’s Attorney</b></h4><p><span>Laura Bruner’s attorney, William Brennan, announced her husband’s passing on Monday, April 3. She has not yet released a statement regarding her husband’s arrest or passing, as she is very distressed by the news. After the revelation, she urged the media to respect her privacy at this crucial time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Brennan has been defending Bruner’s position as the case has received widespread media attention. During the middle of March, Ryan C Cooper’s book Betrayed: The True Story of Roy McGrath topped Amazon’s best-seller list. According to Brennan, Bruner was unaware of the author’s identity.</span></p><p>Advertisement</p><h4><b>The Wedding Of Laura Bruner And Roy McGrath Took Place After The Indictment</b></h4><p><span>When Roy McGrath’s indictment surfaced last September, the couple’s marriage was scrutinized. A possible damaging text message from Bruner was introduced as evidence in September 2022.</span></p><p><span>Bruner allegedly provided in-depth reports of the couple’s international travels via text messages. In August 2019 on a European cruise and again in Naples, Florida, McGrath said he was employed for the two excursions in question.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This meant he received compensation for his time. The text exchanges were intended to be used as evidence by the prosecution to refute McGrath’s claims.</span></p><p><span>Bruner was able to assert spousal privilege because he and McGrath were married after he was charged in October 2021. She may therefore avoid giving testimony against her husband.</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ex-Maryland political aide Roy McGrath is confirmed dead after manhunt <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">#maryland</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">#manhunt</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">#RoyMcGrath</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">#politicalaide</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">pic.twitter.com/a3KlAgsnBc</a></p><p>— Troy jass (@TroyJass) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">April 4, 2023</a></p><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal rel="noopener noreferrer">ALSO READ: Rainbow Rashmika Mandanna Telugu movie release date, cast, plot story, director</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrAsbvRraqgqpGeuW%2BvzqZmsKCfYra0ecuarKuZXZe%2FtrrEq2SwoZaaerCyjKumsmWdmLSzrdOhZJqrXZ2ytHnKoqOlnZRitq95y5qrnqukYsKxsMCtnGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
