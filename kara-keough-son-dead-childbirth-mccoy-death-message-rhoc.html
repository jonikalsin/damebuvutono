A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world. So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy.” John 16:20 Until we see you again... We love you, McCoy.</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kara Bosworth</a> (@karakeoughboz) on Apr 14, 2020 at 9:17am PDT</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>(Photo credit: Kara Keough/Instagram)&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Kara Keough with her husband, Kyle Bosworth and their daughter, Decker.
