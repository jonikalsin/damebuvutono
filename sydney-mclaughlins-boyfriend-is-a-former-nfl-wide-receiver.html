In December of that year, they initially disclosed their connection by posting a photo of themselves on Instagram.</p><h2>Sydney McLaughlin’s Parents were Athletes Too!</h2><p>McLaughlin’s parents, William and Mary McLaughlin, were also athletes, much like her and her partner.&nbsp;William or Willie, the hurdler’s father, was a semi-finalist in the 400m at the 1984 Olympic trials. Her mother, Mary, was a high school runner who specialized in the 400m and 800m.&nbsp;Taylor McLaughlin, McLaughlin’s elder brother, had also won silver in the 400m hurdles at the 2016 IAAF World U20 Championships.&nbsp;The Olympic gold medallist was born on August 7, 1999, in Dunellen, New Jersey, to an elder sister, Morgan, an older brother, Taylor, and a younger brother, Ryan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sydney-McLaughlin-1.jpg><p>Willie complimented his son and daughter for their outstanding high school results in an interview with a local internet media outlet.&nbsp;“We aren’t astonished by what Taylor and Sydney have done,” he said, adding, “but they’re still just 16 and 14, so we want to make sure they’re not putting pressure on themselves.” We are quite proud of them.”</p><h2>Sydney McLaughlin’s Ethnic Origins</h2><p>McLaughlin’s heritage is African American, according to different web publications, despite the fact that she has not publicly stated it in public.&nbsp;Her father is supposedly African American, while her mother is of European ethnicity.&nbsp;McLaughlin is also of American nationality since she was born and reared in the United States.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqspyemsZuucKlmK6fmKG2r7%2BMm6aynqKesq%2BwjKKqZpldm7yzucSrZKeenGLEqrDEZqmem5Wew6a%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
