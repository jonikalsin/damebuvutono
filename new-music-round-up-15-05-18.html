Speaking about the track, Noah said: “This song and the way everything came together means so much to me. The [single] cover is actually a photo of my grandparents who met on a Monday, got married on Friday and were together for 29 years until my grandpa passed away when my mom was 19. I wrote this song for someone I love very much and my Mammie and Glenmore inspired so much of it.”</p><p></p><h4>Bonnie McKee – ‘Mad Mad World’</h4><p>Pop singer-songwriter Bonnie McKee is back with her euphoric new single, ‘Mad Mad World’. Produced by S1 and Shndo, Bonnie wrote the song a few days after the tragic Las Vegas shooting last fall. According to Bonnie, “the underlying message of the song is that today more than ever, people need to come together, pay attention to what’s happening around the world, stand up against hate and make their voices heard.”</p><h4>Molly Moore –&nbsp;Third Eye High&nbsp;EP</h4><p>Multi-talented Los Angeles based artist Molly Moore has released her highly anticipated&nbsp;Third Eye High&nbsp;EP. The four-track EP is a diverse collection of gorgeous indie and electro-pop musings made up of ‘Tough Love’, ‘No Stress’, ‘Catch and Release’ and ‘Lighten Up’.</p><h4>Catherine McGrath – ‘Wild’ Acoustic</h4><p>Rising UK country-pop star Catherine McGrath has treated fans to the acoustic version of her latest single ‘Wild’. Speaking about the track, she said: “This song is one of my favourites I’ve written. It’s about a guy who I liked but who still wasn’t over his ex. He took me to a Coldplay concert that he was meant to go to with his ex and half the time he was holding my hand, the other half he was texting her. Every time we were together he was only ever halfway there and the day after the concert I went into the studio and ended up writing about the whole thing. It’s really honest and I think that’s what I love most about it.”</p><h4>Madison Mars – ‘Back The Funk’</h4><p>Estonian DJ and producer Madison Mars is back with a new track called ‘Back The Funk’, available now on Tiesto’s Musical Freedom label. Speaking about the wild future house track, he said: “With the upcoming festival season in mind, I wanted to create something different and energetic for my DJ sets. ‘Back The Funk’ is a perfect blend of different house music genres, delivering that true mainstage feel and vibes.”</p><h4>Ria Mae – ‘Red Light’ Shura Remix</h4><p>Canadian singer-songwriter Ria Mae has delivered the remix of her hit ‘Red Light’, by UK artist/producer Shura. The Shura remix, a deep and atmospheric reworking, relies on soulful chord progression and crisp melodies. The original track is taken from her 2017 released EP&nbsp;My Love,&nbsp;which was nominated for a Juno Award.</p><h4>Charlotte Black – ‘Nobody Else’</h4><p>Electro-pop artist Charlotte Black has released her infectious new single ‘Nobody Else’, which concludes a debut trilogy of tracks alongside ‘All Over You’ and ‘SYCL’. Speaking about the track, which captures the ups and downs of finding summer love, Charlotte said: “This is my favourite out of the three, for me it captures that intense feeling of summer love, and how in those fleeting fiery moments you really don’t want ‘Nobody Else’. It concludes my trilogy by leaving listeners on a bit of an emotional cliff hanger. Will she or won’t she pursue her summer love in the following tracks…”</p><h4>What was your favourite new music release this week?
