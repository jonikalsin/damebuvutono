Fantasia began singing at the age of 5, citing <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Aretha Franklin</a></strong>, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Patti Labelle</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Tina Turner</a></strong> as major influences. While attending Andrews High School, Fantasia was sexually assaulted by a classmate. The embarrassment over the rape forced her to drop out. She moved to the neighboring Greensboro, and stayed there before trying out for the 2004 <a href=# rel=noopener>American Idol</a> auditions in Atlanta. Fantasia quickly won over audiences and judges with her music talent. Her rendition of the song “Summertime” was called the best performance in the show’s [then] history by <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Randy Jackson</a></strong>. Over 65 million votes were cast to during the final tally, awarding Fantasia the victory. After Idol, she signed to J Records and released her debut single, “I Believe,” in June 2004. It went on to be the top selling single that year and was certified double platinum. Her debut album came in 2004, and went on to sell over two million copies worldwide. She continued to find success, releasing three more albums and winning the Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance in 2011. Along with singing, Fantasia has pursued an acting career, portraying Aretha in an episode of American Dreams and performing in the Broadway adaptation of The Color Purple and the play After Midnight.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>Fantasia is best known as an R&B singer who won the third season of American Idol in 2004.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>At 16, Fantasia gave birth to her first child, a daughter named <strong>Zion</strong>.
