During the finale episode, which aired in December, Vinny and Akielia decided to give their relationship a shot away from the cameras. Unfortunately, though, the romance didn’t last. “We are no longer together,” Vinny confirmed to&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY while promoting the upcoming season of&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jersey Shore</a> on Jan. 4. “I did remain friends with Akielia after the show, but once you’re in the real world, outside of that&nbsp;Double Shot at Love house, things are a little different. We just were better off as friends.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>This was Vinny’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>third attempt at finding love</a> on the MTV reality series, but so far, he has not had the same luck as his pal,&nbsp;<strong>Pauly D</strong>. Pauly first met his now-girlfriend,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nikki Hall</strong></a>, on the show’s first season in 2019, and they started dating after she returned for season 2. Pauly and Nikki <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>served as mentors</a> for Vinny as he tried to find what they have on season 3, but unfortunately, it didn’t work out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/vinny-guadagnino-and-akielia-rucker-split-mtv-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Fans suspected that Vinny and Akielia had broken up when neither of them discussed the relationship on social media after the&nbsp;Double Shot at Love&nbsp;finale. Vinny also does not follow Akielia on Instagram, although she still follows him. The “Keto Guido” said that the aftermath of his relationship with Akielia won’t be featured on the upcoming season of&nbsp;Jersey Shore, which premieres on Jan. 6. Luckily, there’s still plenty of good content to come!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>As for Vinny’s love life, he’s starting to feel ready to sette down like his&nbsp;Jersey Shore castmates. “I’m at a point where, naturally, I’ve slowed down a lot when it comes to night clubs and partying and drinking every night, and that kind of went hand in hand with my single life,” he admitted. “So I definitely wouldn’t mind having somebody that’s a little more constant. I don’t know, I guess I don’t know if I have high standards, or I’m picky, or if it’s just too hard to find someone that matches me. So I’m not really rushing it until I find that person.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>This season of&nbsp;Jersey Shore: Family Vacation will feature the return of&nbsp;<strong>Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi</strong>, who stepped away from the show last season to steer clear of drama and focus on her family. We’ll also see&nbsp;<strong>Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino</strong> as a dad for the first time after welcoming his son, <strong>Romeo</strong>, in May. Plus, Pauly and Nikki’s relationship will be highlighted, and fans will get to see where&nbsp;<strong>Angelina Pivarnick</strong> stands with husband <strong>Chris Larangeira&nbsp;</strong>following their issues last season. Jersey Shore returns on Jan. 6 at 8:00 p.m. on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye49tZq%2BhnqPGbrPUmpuan56eu7B5wKSgnqSZlnqzwcKknKtlo6W5qsCMnaaumpyaerS0zq1kmqxdoby3sY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
