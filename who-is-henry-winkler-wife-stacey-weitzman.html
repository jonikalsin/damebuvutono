His middle name, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the “H” in his first name are references to his Uncle Helmut. He is the cousin of actor Richard Belzer and has an older sister named Beatrice.</p><p>Winkler applied to 28 universities but was accepted to only two of them, Emerson College in Boston, which he attended in 1963. He majored in theater and minored in child psychology because he wanted to be a child psychologist if he didn’t make it as an actor. He was also a member of the Alpha Pi Theta fraternity and played the titular character in Emerson’s production of Peer Gynt. “I nearly flunked out my first year [at Emerson], I nearly flunked out my second year, but I was able to go for four years,” Winkler said afterward. He graduated in 1967, and Emerson bestowed upon him an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in 1978. (DHL).</p><h2>Who is Henry Winkler’s wife Stacey Weitzman?</h2><p>Winkler met Stacey in a Los Angeles clothes store in 1976, and they married in the synagogue where he had his bar mitzvah in 1978. They have two children, Max and Zoe, and Winkler’s stepson is Jed Weitzman, Stacey’s son from her former marriage with Howard Weitzman.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51kxKm7jKKqZqCVo7%2B6edaipaSklad6uLXFnmSsrJGYsrp51p6grbKdlrtw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
